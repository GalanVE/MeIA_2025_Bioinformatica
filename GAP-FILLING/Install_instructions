    DNNgior uses AI to improve gap-filling by learning from the presence and absence of metabolic reactions across diverse bacterial genomes

INSTALLATION

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create the environment:

conda create --name dnngior python=3.10.16

When prompted, confirm the installation by typing y and pressing Enter. After that, activate the environment

conda activate dnngior

First, we must install GUROBI optimizer (for further information, you can check on https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/14799677517585-Getting-Started-with-Gurobi-Optimizer). Visit the Download Gurobi Optimizer page (https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi- software/) and download it. Now, you need edit the bashrc. Follow the steps bellow:

    open a terminal

    go to root directory using cd

    open the bashrc file. We suggest use gedit, nano or vim

nano ~/.bashrc

    add the following line in the bashrc:

export PATH=’path-to-gurobi-bin-folder/bin/:$PATH’

to locate the path-to-gurobi-bin-folder, you have to go to the directory where you have extracted the files from the downloaded tar.gz folder

Second, we need a Gurobi license, a linear programming solver. You can obtain a free academic named-user-license here https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license/ with your institutional email.

click on named-user-license. You will generate one grbgetkey to your machine. Please, type (changing the X for your respective key):

grbgetkey 9f4XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX

Now, you will install DNNgior (inside your conda environment) with the following command:

pip install dnngior

In order to run the dnngior pipeline on a jupyter notebook, you need to install jupyter inside your conda environment with the following command:

conda install -c conda-forge notebook -y
or
pip install notebook

Open a new notebook typing jupyter-notebook on the terminal and test your dnngior installation by typing:

import dnngior

In some instances, you can find a version inconsistency with numpy, one of the dependencies of dnngior. To fix this, go to the terminal and type:

pip install numpy==1.23.5

Then, test your dnngior installation again. You should see this:

Set parameter Username
Set parameter LicenseID to value 2671523
Academic license - for non-commercial use only - expires 2026-05-27
WARNING: To enable the NN_Trainer script, you need to install
tensorflow https://www.tensorflow.org/install,→
The rest of dnngior features can be used without it.

You should be ready to go!
